Teacher's Grade Book
This project serves as a teacher's grade book for primary educators.
It is structured to allow a single adminstrator to set up grading for a school by entering students and teachers.
Teachers, once entered, are able to access a unique classroom that allows them to track assignments and schores for individual students. Each teacher can only interact with students assigned to their classroom. Students may be assigned to more than one classroom anticipating middle and high school applications, though this functionality is not supported at this time.
Students are able to access their grades and individual profiles.
A number of reports that can be generated depending on the user's level of access after relevent information has been entered by users.
Finally, all reports can be exported as .csv files for external use, while all program data is stored in binary files.

This program was created in VisualStudio2022 & VSCoede and, while it should not have dependencies, it may.
It is meant to run in your local IDE.

This program operates under the MIT open source license.
